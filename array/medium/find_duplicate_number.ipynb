    "**Intuition**  \n",
    "Consider an array that has n distinct numbers in the range [1,n]. For example: [1,2,3,4,5]. If we pick any one of these 5 numbers and count how many numbers are less than or equal to it, the answer will be equal to that number. So in [1,2,3,4,5], if you pick the number 4, there's exactly 4 numbers that are less than or equal to 4. If you pick 3, there's exactly 3 numbers that are less than or equal to 3, and so on. However, when you have duplicates in the array, this count will exceed the number at some point. For example: in [4,3,4,5,2,4,1], 3 has 3 numbers less than or equal to it. However, the duplicate number will have a count of numbers less than or equal to itself, that is greater than itself (in this example, 4, which is the duplicate, has 6 numbers that are less than or equal to it). Hence, the smallest number that satisfies this property is the duplicate number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example: [4,6,4,2,1,4,3,5]. This has n+1 elements where n = 7. Take each number from 1 to 7 and count how many numbers are less than or equal to it. In our example, count(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) = (1,2,3,6,7,8,8). If we performed a linear scan, we would find that the number 4 is the first number to have its counts exceed the actual number (i.e. 6 > 4) - hence 4 is the duplicate. A linear scan based approach would require an overall O($n^2)$ time complexity in the worst case, since we'd need to iterate over each of the n numbers (requiring O(n) time), and then compare it to every element to generate a count of equal or lower numbers (requiring O(n) time as well - nested inside the other O(n) loop). Fortunately, count is monotonic (it's values are always in non-decreasing order), and hence it is an excellent candidate for binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the binary search approach, instead of doing a linear scan from 1 to n, we can apply a binary search with a goal of finding the smallest number that satisfies the aforementioned property. We start with a search space of [1,n] that has a midpoint mid. If mid satisfies the property, we narrow our search space to the left half [1,mid−1] and continue searching, otherwise, we narrow our search space to the right half [mid+1,n].\n",
    "\n",
    "`To observe the monotonicity of count, consider the evaluation: \"For the given number, the count of numbers less than or equal to it, exceeds the number itself\". Going back to our example, we had derived: count(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) = (1,2,3,6,7,8,8). If we now take the first number and apply said evaluation, we get false (since count(1) == 1, which is not greater than 1). Applying this evaluation to all counts, we get (false,false,false,true,true,true,true). Observe how this remains false in the beginning, and switches to true for the number 4 (i.e. the duplicate), after which point it remains true for all further numbers. Formally, the count for each number must include itself plus the count of all numbers less than itself. Since a number cannot have a negative count, each number, N, must have a count greater than or equal to the count of N-1. Since count(N)>=count(N−1), count must be monotonically increasing.`"

    "**Approach 6: Sum of Set Bits**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**  \n",
    "Consider an example [3,1,3,2,4]. This has n+1 elements where n = 4. If we did not have the duplicate, and instead had every number from 1 through 4, this base array would have been [1,2,3,4]. Let's look at each of these numbers in binary and count the number of times 1 is seen at each bit position (let's call that base_count). Since the largest number is 4 ($100_2$​ in binary notation), we need to count this for the 3 least significant bits:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, base_count = [0,0,0]\n",
    "- After 1 (in binary, $001_2$), base_count = [0,0,1]\n",
    "- After 2 (in binary, $010_2$), base_count = [0,1,1]\n",
    "- After 3 (in binary, $011_2$), base_count = [0,2,2]\n",
    "- After 4 (in binary, $100_2$), base_count = [1,2,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the base count established, let's go through the example array [3,1,3,2,4] and calculate the same (sum of 1's set across all bit positions) in this array. Let's call it nums_count:  \n",
    "- Initially, nums_count = [0,0,0]\n",
    "- After 3 (in binary, $011_2$​), nums_count = [0,1,1]\n",
    "- After 1 (in binary, $001_2$​), nums_count = [0,1,2]\n",
    "- After 3 (in binary, $011_2$​), nums_count = [0,2,3]\n",
    "- After 2 (in binary, $010_2$​), nums_count = [0,3,3]\n",
    "- After 4 (in binary, $100_2$​), nums_count = [1,3,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing nums_count to base_count, we see that the bit count difference is [1,3,3] - [1,2,2] = [0,1,1]. This is the equivalent of the number 3, which is the duplicate. By iterating over each bit, and comparing the base to the current, we were able to construct the duplicate number bit by bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does this work if the duplicate number appears more than twice? In that case, think of it as simply replacing the missing numbers with the duplicate number, effectively reducing the count of 1's corresponding to the missing numbers and adding 1's associated with the duplicate number - so the algorithm remains intact, since the count of 1's will be even more pronounced in favor of the duplicate number.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, consider the same array but with the duplicate occurring more than twice: [3,1,3,3,3] (we've replaced both 2 and 4 with 3). base_count will remain [1,2,2] because n still equals 4. However, nums_count becomes [0,4,5]. Comparing nums_count to base_count, we see that the bit count difference is [0,4,5] - [1,2,2] = [−1,2,3]. If we consider just the positive counts (seen at positions 0 and 1), this, again is the equivalent of the number 3, which is the duplicate number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good question to ask here is \"Why does only including the bits with a positive count result in the duplicate number?\" To understand this, let's take a step back and reconsider the example array [3,1,3,2,4]. However, for this example ignore the binary representation of each number. Pretend base_count is an array where base_count[num] contains the frequency of number num. So for the range [1,4], base_count is [1,1,1,1] and nums_count is the count of each number ([1,1,2,1]). Then the difference is [1,1,2,1]−[1,1,1,1]=[0,0,1,0]. The third index is the only index to have a positive count and thus 3 is the duplicate number.\n",
    "\n",
    "To meet the constant space requirement, we will consider one bit at a time and count how many times that bit is set in the numbers [1, 2, ..., n], this will be (base_count) for the bit. Then we will count how many times the bit is set in nums, this will be (nums_count) for the bit. If nums_count−base_count>0 then this bit must be set in the duplicate number.\n",
    "\n",
    "`A key observation is that if the array had nnn elements instead of n+1 (where each element is in the range [1,n]),this solution would not work. For example, if the input array was [1,3,3], then base_count = [2,2] and nums_count = [2,3], resulting in a difference of [0,1] and hence 1 as the reconstructed number, which is incorrect. The n+1 number ensures that number from 1 to n appear exactly once and plus one extra number.`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note on bit manipulation\n",
    "- (1<<m) accesses the $m^th$ bit. For example, $1 = 0001_2$ and (1<<3) = 8 = $1000_2$ notice 1 was bit shifted to the left 3 places in the binary representation.\n",
    "- To check if the $m^{th}$ bit is set to 1 in a number num, we can use if(((1 << m) & num) > 0). For example, (1 << 2) & 12 = 4 & 12 = $0100_{2}$​ & $1100_{2}$ = $0100_{2}$ = 4 which is nonzero, this tells us that the $3^{rd}$ bit from the right in the number 12 is set to 1. Notice only bits that were set in both 4 and 12 remain after performing the bitwise AND operation.\n"
